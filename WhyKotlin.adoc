Kotlin has the following characteristics that make developing Wicket applications easier.

- named parameters
- default parameters
- no `new` keyword
- semicolon not needed to terminate a statement
- extension functions to add functionality
- function literals with receiver
- operator overloading
- infix operators
- generic reification (inlining)
- compact constructor/property definitions
- multiple top-level classes per file
- nullability

Themes
- `this` manipulation, including a nullable this

Config: nullable, r/w props for creating a Component, except the id
Factory: Id + Config -> Component
// Builder: Config -> (String) -> Component
Queued: Id + Config + Config.Block -> q(Component)
Tag: No Id + Parent + Config + Config.Block -> Parent + Component

What is the builder buying us? -- nothing: both *queue and *tag can be written in terms of config + factory

What is the relationship between the config classes/interface and the config() functions? can they be combined?
The thing that is slightly tricky about this is that not all of the config parameters can be applied _after_
the component is created. Some of the properties have to be used in the process of creating the component
(e.g., group for Check)
